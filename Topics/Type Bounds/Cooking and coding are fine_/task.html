  <p>You have your own small kitchen with a <code class="java">Microwave</code> and a <code class="java">Multicooker</code> for now. As an engineer, you have discovered that they implement the interfaces <code class="java">Logger</code> (with a <code class="java">log()</code> method) and <code class="java">Cooker</code> (with a <code class="java">cook()</code> method). For further engineering, you need to complete a generic class <code class="java">SmartKitchen</code> that takes only the types which implement both <code class="java">Cooker</code> and <code class="java">Logger</code>. Complete its method <code class="java">finishCooking()</code>, which takes allowed devices and invokes <code class="java">log()</code>.</p>
